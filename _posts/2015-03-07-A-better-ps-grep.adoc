A better ps + grep
==================

I often fall into this pitfall because it happens to be the first snapse that fires in my brain about how to go about doing a combined ps + grep.

Let's say, I want to see if `iterm` is running. I would do something like this:

`22:35 (awsation@localhost) >> ~/Work/git_repos/dotfiles $ ps -ef | grep iterm`

I would get an output like this:


`22:35 (awsation@localhost) >> ~/Work/git_repos/dotfiles $ ps -ef | grep -i iterm`
  
  `502 48206  2444   0 15Jan15 ??         4:51.14 /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm
  502 88832 48228   0 10:35pm ttys002    0:00.00 grep -i iterm`

I would usually, ignore the extra `grep -i iterm`. But stubmling upon Chris's blog:

I now have a fix and another alias to play with: `px iterm` :)

Thanks Chris.
